## Books

#### Understanding Digital Computers - Radio Shack (Forrest Mims)

This was the first book I read that explained the inner workings of a computer and is
still one of the best instructions to the subject.  The Forrest M. Mims Radio Shack books
like this one and the Engineer's Notebook series must have inspired countless engineers
over the years.

#### Digital Computer Electronics - Paul Malvino

This is the definitive source for the SAP-1 design and its successors.  It also
includes a wealth of other source material that leads up to the design.  This is not
written at the same beginner level as the Mims book, but it covers the subject with much
more detail.

## Links

These are a just a few of the other breadboard computers and interesting sites I've run
across while building this project.  There is a large community willing to learn and share
what they know with others.

[Ben Eater 8-bit computer (SAP-1)](https://eater.net/8bit) is **the** starting point for
these projects.  This video series builds a simple computer from the ground up and
explains all of the design aspects along the way.  Don't bother with any other sites
before checking this one out.  The website also has complete kits of parts available to
build a SAP-1.

On the [r/beneater reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/), there is a
["What I Have Learned"](https://www.reddit.com/r/beneater/comments/dskbug/what_i_have_learned_a_master_list_of_what_to_do/)
post by lordmonoxide.  This is full of useful debug tips, including the solution to a
noise problem on the HALT line that was causing my clock circuit to double count.

[Troy Schrapel's vrcpu](https://github.com/visrealm/vrcpu) is a breadboard computer that
is supported by a wireless program loader, an assembler, and a web-based graphical
emulator.

The [Rolf Electronics 8-bit SAP-3](https://github.com/rolf-electronics/The-8-bit-SAP-3)
is a very nicely constructed and well-documented extension to the SAP-1.

The [Homebrew Computer Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HomebrewComputerClubUK) group
on facebook has a lot of posts featuring 8-bit breadboard computers and other interesting
projects.
